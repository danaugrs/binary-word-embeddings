# SDR Generator

Generates sparse distributed representations for a provided list of words by naively analyzing Wikipedia.

## What's cool about this

Once you've generated the data:

- `similarTo('Google')` outputs `[('Microsoft', 5), ('Amazon', 3), ('Samsung', 3), ...]`
- `similarTo('Toyota')` outputs `[('Lexus', 13), ('Volkswagen', 7), ('Ford', 6), ('Hyundai', 4), ...]`
- `similarTo('Colombia')` outputs `[('Venezuela', 11), ('Ecuador', 10), ('Peru', 9), ...]`

## How to generate the data

To see available command line options: `generate.py -h`

Example usages:
- `generate.py -l countries`
- `generate.py --list topBrands --nworkers 10`

Several example lists are provided in the `/lists` directory.

## Example output

Generated by `test.py`.
